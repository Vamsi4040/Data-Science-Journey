# About Me

I'm a passionate data scientist with a unique blend of skills in predictive analytics, statistical modeling, and machine learning. With a foundation in mechanical engineering and a Master's in Data Science, I bring a comprehensive analytical perspective to solve complex challenges. I am particularly interested in NLP applications for mental health and deploying scalable AI solutions on the cloud.
