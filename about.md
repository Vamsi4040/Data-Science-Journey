# About Me

<div style="display: flex; align-items: center;">
  <div style="flex: 1;">
    <p>Hello, my name is Ganga Vamsik Sanipinidi. I am currently pursuing a Master’s in Data Science at the University of New Haven with an expected graduation in May 2025. My academic journey has equipped me with a robust skill set to solve real-world data challenges. I have executed projects in Natural Language Processing and Deep Learning and am presently tackling complex problems in Computer Vision. With an undergraduate background in Mechanical Engineering, I bring an interdisciplinary perspective that enriches my approach to data science. Additionally, as a Data Science Intern at Colaberry, I manage APIs while actively learning and contributing to the company’s culture. I also hold a certification in Azure Machine Learning, further enhancing my expertise in cloud-based machine learning solutions. I am passionate about leveraging data-driven insights to drive innovation and create transformative solutions.</p>
