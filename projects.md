## Bankruptcy Prediction
Developed a robust predictive model to forecast bankruptcy risks using financial data. Implemented algorithms like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost to identify companies/individuals at risk.

## Emotion Analysis in Mental Health (NLP)
Designed an NLP-based system to detect depression from social media text using models such as CNN-LSTM, BERT, and DistilBERT.

## Fake News Detection
Built a deep learning model using fine-tuned DistilBERT to accurately classify news as real or fake. Included steps for data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and real-time deployment.
